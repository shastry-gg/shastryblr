- 👋 Hi, I’m Ganesha
I am on github to better understand the tech that powers my designs.
- :briefcase: Officially I am a Product Designer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the box model, and liquid layouts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting FOSS projects that need a product designer's skills.
- 📫 You can send a mail to ganesha@hey.com to catch up on FOSS, Design and Tech in general.
